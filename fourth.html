        <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>
        <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>
        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
        <p>A Chinee tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors raher than her violators.  That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time.  I coul not help but love and cherish her.</p>
        <p>For those who have seen the Earth form space, and for the hundreds and perhpas thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective.  The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>
    

        <h4>One Step for Man</h4>
        <p>We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.</p>
    
    		<blockquote class="blockquote">
        	<em>Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10.</em></blockquote>
        
		<p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.<p/>
        
        <h4>Reaching for the Stars</h4>
        <p>As we got further and further away, it (the Earth) diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine.  That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart.  Seeing this had to change a man.</p>

        <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round. I believe I never knew what the word round meant until I saw Earth from space.</p>
        <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>
		<p>The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!</p>
